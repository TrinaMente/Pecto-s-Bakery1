                    <p>Lucia Abillar from Lucban Quezon has a Bachelor of Science in nursing. 
                        After graduation, she started in a hospital as a volunteer to gain 
                        experience. When her father passed away, she decided to take over the 
                        family business, a well-known bakery, which was left to her in his
                        inheritance. Being the youngest of the family she started operating 
                        the bakery together with her spouse in 1984. The business is running 
                        for over 67 years now and it's a true family business, with Lucia's 
                        husband and older children working in the company as well.<br><br>

                        They currently employ 30 workers, most of them are high school and 
                        elementary graduates. They provide above minimum wage for the regular 
                        employees with a 13th month pay. For over 10 years they have been 
                        providing free breakfast in Sinag Kalinga Foundation, a home for 
                        the elderly as their way to commit the community.<br><br>
                        
                        Lucia's dream is to start exporting their products in 2015, after 
                        they've gathered all required documents. Together with local partner 
                        NPFC, Lendahand will provide Lucia with a loan to realize her ambitions
                        and expand her business.</p>
